## A potent set of implementations and extension to the Swift `Codable` system

### Why?
The framework aims to solve three major pain points experienced with Swift's `Codable` system:

* Allow decoding and/or encoding values of unknown structure (e.g. any encoded value)
* Support polymorphic type encoding/decoding while still allowing Swift to implement `Codable` 
* Reduce the complexity and amount of code required to implement and test new serialization formats
* Provide a library of fully featured implementations of popular serialization formats

## Integration

### Swift Package Manager 
PotentCodables currently supports Swift Package Manager for project integration. Add a package dependency similar to the following:  
```swift
  .package(url: "https://github.com/outfoxx/PotentCodables.git", from: "1.0.0")
```
