# ``PotentASN1``

Reading and writing ASN.1 encoded data, as well as schema oriented support for encoding and decoding. 

## Overview

PotentASN1 provides a conformant implementation for reading and writing 
[ASN.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One) encoded data. Additionally, encoding and decoding
via Swift's `Codable` framework is provided using schemas.
